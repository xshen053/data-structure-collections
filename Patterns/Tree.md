For trees, some things we should consider are:
- Using a traversal (ie. Pre-Order, In-Order, Post-Order, Level-Order)
  - With a traversal we can visit every node, including the leaf nodes
  - If we can find the depth of every leaf, we can find the min depth
  - We should find a way to keep track of the depth of each node we visit while traversing
- Using binary search to find an element
  - The tree is not ordered in any way, and we should probably visit all leaves, so searching for a specific node won't work
- Storing nodes within a HashMap to refer to later
- Applying a level-order traversal with a queue
- BST properties
  - In a BST, the in-order traversal gives nodes in ascending order. The next element in such a traversal is the â€œin-order successor.
