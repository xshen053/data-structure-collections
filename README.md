# Data-structure-collections
This repo includes various common abstract data structures (ADT) and their implementation details using Java.

# Difference between abstract data type and data structure
- ADT: Describes the operations and properties (e.g., each node's left subtree contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key).
- Data Structure: Only describe the structure (don't think about operations and properties),
  - e.g. binary tree is a structure where each node points to left and right children

## Data structure
- Array: a linear data structure - elements are stored at a contiguous location
- Linked List: a linear data structure - elements are not stored at a contiguous location
- Binary Tree: a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child
- Graph: a collection of nodes connected by edges
- Hash Table: A data structure that uses a hash function to map keys to values (consider it as an array with a mechanism for efficient key-based access)
