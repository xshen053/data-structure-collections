## Graph Representation


Choices are made based on
- Runtime
- Memory usage
- Difficulty of implementing various graph algorithms. 


3 ways to represent graph
- Adjacency Matrix
- Edge Sets (Collection of all edge)
- Adjacency lists (Most common)
  - Efficient when graphs are “sparse” (not too many edges).
  - lc 841. Keys and Rooms
